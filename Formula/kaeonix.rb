# Kaeonix is CLOSED-SOURCE. This formula installs a prebuilt binary — it is
# NEVER compiled from source, so it has no source `url`, `head`, or `bottle`.
#
# This is the TEMPLATE. It lives in this repo for review, but the *live* formula
# belongs in the separate public tap repo github.com/feyncode/homebrew-tap at
# Formula/kaeonix.rb. The release CI fills the version and per-arch sha256
# placeholders below and pushes the rendered file there. See README.md here.
